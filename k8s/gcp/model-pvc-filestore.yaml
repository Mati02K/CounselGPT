# Alternative: ReadWriteMany PVC using GCP Filestore
# Use this if you need multiple pods on different nodes

  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany  # Can be mounted by multiple nodes
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi  # Filestore minimum is 100GB (even if you only use 30GB)
  storageClassName: enterprise-rwx  # GCP Filestore NFS

---
# Note: Filestore is more expensive!
# Cost: 100GB × $0.20/GB/month = $20/month (vs $5/month for standard-rwo)
# But it allows multiple pods on different nodes to share the models
