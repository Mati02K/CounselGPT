  "A startup launches modular floating platforms used as anchored cafés with no engines but towable in emergencies. After a storm incident where platforms were towed with people onboard, a dispute arises over whether they are legally 'vessels' based solely on the definition including anything capable of being used for water transportation. Should these platforms be classified as vessels, considering capability vs. ordinary use and whether a single towing event affects legal status?",
  "A district court issues an interlocutory order finding a provision unconstitutional and enjoins the government. The government seeks a direct appeal to the Supreme Court under a statute requiring expedited constitutional appeals, while plaintiffs argue sovereign immunity and congressional privileges were broadly waived. Based only on the statutory text, is the direct appeal mandatory and do sovereign immunity and legislative protections remain intact?",
  "The NRC Chairman delegates section 403(a) authority to the Executive Director of Operations even though the statute allows delegation only to another Commission member, and NRC management restricts the Inspector General from hiring staff despite explicit statutory hiring authority. Based on the statute, is the Chairman’s delegation valid, and can NRC management legally limit the IG’s hiring authority?",
  "The Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Border Security orders aggressive SEVIS-based enforcement while the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services issues conflicting lenient policies. Local offices request suspension of the statutory managerial rotation program. Under the statute, how should DHS resolve the enforcement conflict, and can the rotation program be paused?",
  "A company files mandated cyber incident and ransom reports under section 681b. Later, plaintiffs seek the reports in discovery, a state regulator attempts to use the report as the sole basis for enforcement, and a journalist files a FOIA request. Based on statutory protections, which uses—discovery, regulatory enforcement, or FOIA disclosure—are permitted or barred?",
  "TSA develops a hazardous-materials truck tracking program, but the statute says the Secretary may not mandate the technology without additional congressional authority. Years later TSA mandates nationwide installation of tracking and remote-disable devices. Does the statute permit this mandate, or does the 'may not mandate' clause prohibit it despite TSA’s broader security powers?"
